# WWDC 2016 theme for HyperTerm

[HyperTerm](https://hyperterm.org) theme based on [my WWDC theme for Vim, Sublime and Atom](https://github.com/snazzyham/wwdc-2016). Forked from @mdo's fork of @jxnblk's [HyperTerminator](https://github.com/jxnblk/hyperterminator).

### Install

1. Open HyperTerm's preferences with `Cmd+,` (or manually at `~/.hyperterm.js`) with your editor.
